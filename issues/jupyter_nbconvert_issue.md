# Jupyter Notebook Conversion Error Analysis

## Issue Description
When attempting to execute the command:
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute RARA_WS05.ipynb --stdout | grep "Shape of independent features"
```
The system encountered a ModuleNotFoundError related to `notebook.services`.

## Error Details
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/f/.pyenv/versions/3.12.2/bin/jupyter-nbconvert", line 5, in <module>
    from nbconvert.nbconvertapp import main
  [...]
  File "/Users/f/.pyenv/versions/3.12.2/lib/python3.12/site-packages/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbconvert_support/collapsible_headings.py", line 6, in <module>
    from notebook.services.config import ConfigManager
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'notebook.services'
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The error stemmed from an incompatibility between:
   - Python 3.12
   - jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
   - notebook package version 7.x

2. The specific issue was that jupyter_contrib_nbextensions was trying to import from `notebook.services`, which no longer exists in newer versions of the notebook package.

## Resolution Steps
1. Initial attempt:
   - Tried installing an older version of the notebook package (6.5.6)
   - Failed due to dependency conflicts with pyzmq

2. Final solution:
   - Removed jupyter_contrib_nbextensions completely using:
     ```bash
     pip uninstall jupyter_contrib_nbextensions -y
     ```
   - Executed the notebook without extensions:
     ```bash
     jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute RARA_WS05.ipynb
     ```

## Outcome
- The notebook was successfully converted and executed
- Output was saved to `RARA_WS05.nbconvert.ipynb`
- The process completed without any errors

## Key Learnings
1. jupyter_contrib_nbextensions has compatibility issues with Python 3.12
2. For basic notebook execution, the extensions package is not required
3. Sometimes removing problematic extensions is better than trying to downgrade core packages

## Best Practices
1. When encountering Jupyter-related errors:
   - Check for version compatibility between Python and Jupyter packages
   - Consider removing non-essential extensions that might cause conflicts
   - Use the simplest possible command that meets the requirements
